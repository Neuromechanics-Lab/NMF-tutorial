% Non-negative matrix factorization- Ting and Chvatal
% This is companion material for a chapter entitled “Muscle synergy analysis for posture and movement: methods and interpretation” by Ting and Chvatal, in Progress in Motor Control, Danion and Latash, eds., 2010. 
% We use intuitive tutorials to compare the different properties of principal components analysis and non-negative matrix factorization in the decomposition of electromyographic data.
